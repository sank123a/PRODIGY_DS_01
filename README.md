Task - Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population
# 🚢 Titanic Dataset Visualization in Power BI

This project visualizes the **Titanic dataset** using **Power BI** to analyze and understand patterns in survival, age distribution, gender demographics, and other key variables.

## 📊 Project Overview

Using Power BI, I created interactive dashboards to explore various aspects of the Titanic dataset, including:

- Age distribution of passengers (histogram)
- Gender distribution (bar chart)
- Survival rate analysis
- Class-wise breakdown of passengers
- Combined visual insights for age, class, and survival status

## 📁 Files Included

- `Titanic_Visualization.pbix` — Power BI file containing all dashboards and visuals.
- `README.md` — This documentation file.
- `titanic.csv` (optional) — Titanic dataset used in the project (if you include it).

## 🧰 Tools Used

- **Power BI**
- **Titanic Dataset** (from Kaggle or similar source)

## 📷 Visuals Included

- **Bar Charts:** Gender-wise and class-wise distribution

## ▶️ How to Use

## 📌 Key Insights

* Most survivors were in first class and younger age groups.
* Women and children had higher survival rates than men.
* Third class passengers were the majority but had the lowest survival rate.
